                <h3>FEC approves three Notices of Disposition on petitions for rulemaking</h3>
                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>WASHINGTON â€“ At its open meeting today, the Federal Election Commission approved three Notices of Disposition in connection with petitions for rulemaking.

                    REG 2012-01 (Electioneering Communications Reporting) - Draft Notice of Disposition Prior to the meeting, on March 21, the Commission approved by tally vote the Notice of Disposition of a Petition for Rulemaking by the Center for Individual Freedom. The Commission decided not to initiate a rulemaking in response to the petition, which asked that the Commission revise two regulations on the reporting of electioneering communications, because the regulatory changes sought have already been implemented in a separate rulemaking.
                    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    REG 2015-04 (Citizens United II) - Draft Notice of Disposition The Commission approved a Notice of Disposition of two Petitions for Rulemaking by Makes Your Laws PAC, Inc. and Make Your Laws Advocacy, Inc. and Craig Holman and Public Citizen. The Petitions asked the Commission to revise existing regulations and issue new regulations concerning: (1) disclosure of certain financing information regarding independent expenditures and electioneering communications; (2) election-related spending by foreign nationals; (3) solicitations of corporate and labor organization employees and members; and (4) the independence of expenditures made by independent-expenditure-only political committees and accounts. Because there were not four affirmative votes in support of the Petitions, the Commission is not initiating a rulemaking.</p>
